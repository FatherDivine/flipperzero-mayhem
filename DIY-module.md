You can easily create your DIY version of the board. 

1. First check the connections in [UberGuidoZ](https://github.com/UberGuidoZ/Flipper/blob/main/GPIO/ReadMe.md#documenting-adventures-with-the-gpio)'s repository, especially for the `ESP32` and `NRF24`/`CC1101` modules.

2. Get all the hardware you need following this [list](Features)

3. Install everything in a [prototyping board](https://shop.flipperzero.one/products/proto-boards)

In this stage, your DIY version should look like the prototype version shown [here](Versions#prototype-dec-2023) or also the picture below:

4. Follow [the guide](First-steps) to flash the firmware and FAPs.

5. Enjoy!


**Note:** test different orientations and directions for your camera, the final design uses the camera tilted 90 degrees to the left.
