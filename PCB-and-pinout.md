The PCB is designed to have a set of mirrored pins for _flipping_ it. Useful if you have a camera or a directional antenna. Also, since you could connect more sensors, you can have those looking in any direction:

For controlling the power (ESP32 and NRF) check the following solder pads (by default the ESP32 is powered by 5V and the NRF by 3.3V):

There is prototyping sections for 3 pin sensors. Since this sensors can have any pin ordering, be careful when plugging them on the right position:
