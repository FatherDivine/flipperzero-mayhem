# Kit version (if you need to solder)

If you got the kit version, you should solder the headers and other parts. Check how it should look [here](Versions). For detailed soldering instructions you can check the following video:

_**Note:** Since I am lefty, maybe you should flip some of the instructions. Also, the longer leg in the capacitor is the positive._

# Assembled version (just connect modules)

You may need to finish the assembly connecting the modules and the camera:

* Connect the ESP32 and NRF24/CC1101 following the orientation mark on the pcb

* Insert the camera module as show in the [First steps](First-steps#about-the-camera) page

For more details, check the video below:

# Upload firmware and faps (for the first time)

With the board assembled, you may need to upload the firmware and the faps. Follow the instructions in http://flipper.ried.cl/webinstaller

The following video can help too, but your process can be different. For example, the faps can be already included in some distributions of the firmware for the flipper zero.
