The excellent justcallmekoko's [Marauder](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder) was adapted for running on the ESP32CAM board. All the functionality remains the same, you should check their [wiki](https://github.com/justcallmekoko/ESP32Marauder/wiki).

# Additional features

The only addition is the option to take a full 2 MP jpg photo and turn on and off the flashlight.
